                    <p>I recently sold a house and while this can be a very stressful process, I felt 110% confident by partnering with Alps Housing Company. They were candid, provided great feedback, helped explain clearly all details and managed the actual sale negotiation brilliantly. In addition, they were extremely responsive to every one of my questions, no matter how small. As I move forward to now BUY my next house, I am extremely certain this company will be right to help me navigate this process.</p>

                    <p>My wife and I had a dream of downsizing from our house in London into a small condo closer to where we work and play in Portland. Alps Housing skilled team helped make that dream a reality. The sale went smoothly, and we just closed on an ideal new place we're excited to call home. Nobody knows Portland and the peninsula better than the company. They really listens to clients and goes the extra mile with customer service, too.</p>

                    <p>David was a joy to work with! The breath of his local knowledge of Portland, ME and its environs along with a thorough real estate expertise was invaluable to us Portland novices. He took time to introduce us to the market and then showed us lots of houses so we had great choices to work with. David also understood and worked with our time frame, responding quickly to all queries. Our experience was great from start to finish, thanks to David. We highly recommend him!!</p>

                    <p>I would highly recommend David Marsden. He gave us many helpful suggestions on how to update our home. We followed many of his ideas and our home looked amazing. David is very professional and did a very in depth market analysis to help us determine a selling price. David and his team marketed our house well and showed it often and we were able to get an offer on our home in just 10 days. David and his team were very responsive to any questions or concerns that we had and were always wonderful to deal with. If you are looking for an agent to sell your house, David Marsden should be your first choice.</p>

                    <p>After working with David to sell my home in 2013, I was convinced that he’s the only realtor I’ll ever need. Since then, I’ve bought two properties and sold one, and with each process, David’s knowledge, professionalism and terrific instincts have consistently guided us through to excellent outcomes. It is truly a pleasure to work with David – I’ve found that he keeps his client’s best interests in sharp focus and you can always trust that he is on top of every detail, big and small, which brings great peace of mind in any real estate transaction</p>

                    <p>David is an outstanding agent to work with. He is a skilled listener and negotiator, with very in-depth knowledge of the local markets. My husband and I listed two properties with him at the same time and while he sold one within a week, one took five months to sell. At no point in those five months did his dedication to selling the property waiver. He was just as aggressive and excited about selling the second property as he was the first. Without doubt, we would seek him out immediately for any upcoming real estate transaction in the future.</p>
